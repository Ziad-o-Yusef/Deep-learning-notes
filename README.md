# Deep-learning-notes
## This repo collects all the notebooks related to the Deep Learning Diploma that I experienced in Machinfy Academy, each notebook is a specific exercise about something new that I have learned
### This file will be a map file for the repo :
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## 1- Notebook 1 : From ML to DL 
### Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-sep-2021/data
Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.
To try to compare the algorithms of machine learning and deep learning : Acc : +86% 

## 2- Notebook 2 : TF audio module
Try to get to know the module and how to use it simply and how to perform sound processing from Tensorflow

## 3- Notebook 3 : ANN Regression Model 
###  Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aggarwalrahul/dl-intro-to-nn?select=usedcars.csv
design ANN regression model with different optimizers & lesess functions
